# Hi, everyone!
In this small repository, I put some code for solving problems from discrete mathematics: **finding tree leaves**, **heights**, **some vertices** and **roots**.
**I hope this helps you somehow!**
## ***A small but important note.***
In order to find [leaves](https://github.com/LilPoly/Trees-in-graphs/blob/main/graph/trees/leaves.js) and [internal vertices](https://github.com/LilPoly/Trees-in-graphs/blob/main/graph/trees/internalVertices.js), use the **prufer sequence** given to you, but to find the [root](https://github.com/LilPoly/Trees-in-graphs/blob/main/graph/trees/root.js) and [height](https://github.com/LilPoly/Trees-in-graphs/blob/main/graph/trees/height.js), you also need lists of **adjacency of vertices**.
Be careful!
### Prufer's sequence
I will also attach information about this sequence to you:
